  # About me
</div>

I'm a flutter / dart developer and a self taught UI / UX designer  from Nairobi Kenya. My interests are all about designing and developing both web and mobile applications that have an impact to the society.

When it comes to mobile apps development, I develop  using the flutter and dart ecosystem especially because of it's ability to allow for creation of  multi-platform applications from one code base.

When it comes to design technologies, I am well versant with Figma and Adobe Xd for UI UX design  as well as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Indesign and Adobe Photoshop for general design tasks. 

When not developing applications or designing user interfaces, I create freelance graphic designs and share them both in my design and creative website portfolio: http://cyrusgraphics.com as well as my facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/cyrusgraphics and instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/cyrusgraphics/
