I'm a UI / UX designer hobbyist and mobile apps engineer from Nairobi Kenya. I am passionate baout designing and building applications that have an impact to the society around me. Somthing that makes performing every day's activities simpler  and more efficient. 

Some of the design technologies I enjoy working with include Figma, Adobe Xd, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Indesign and Adobe Photoshop. When not developing mobile applications I create freelance graphic designs and share at http://cyrusgraphics.com.

when it comes to mobile apps development I am a flutter nad dart die hard.  My interest in  mobile applications development specifically with the flutter / dart ecosystem led me to launch React Robins, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
